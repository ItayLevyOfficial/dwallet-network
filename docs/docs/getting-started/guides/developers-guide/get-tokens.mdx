title: Get DWLT Tokens
---

dWallet faucet is a helpful tool where dWallet developers can get free test DWLT tokens to deploy and interact with their programs on dWallet's Testnet.

## Prerequisites

To request tokens from the faucet, you must own a dWallet Account address that can receive the DWALT tokens.

## Find your dWallet Account address
When a dWallet Client connects to the network, it has an account address. You can see it running the following command:
```
dwallet client active-address
```

## Request test tokens through cURL

Use the following cURL command to request tokens directly from the faucet server:

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://faucet.alpha.testnet.dwallet.cloud/gas' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "FixedAmountRequest": {
        "recipient": "<YOUR DWALLET ACCOUNT ADDRESS>"
    }
}'
```

If you're working with a local network, replace `'http://faucet.alpha.testnet.dwallet.cloud/gas'` with `'http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas'`.

## Request test tokens through TypeScript SDK

You can also access the faucet using the Sui TypeScript-SDK.

```typescript
import { requestSuiFromFaucetV0 } from '@mysten/sui.js/faucet';

// get tokens from the Testnet faucet server
const response = await requestSuiFromFaucetV0({
    // connect to Testnet faucet
    host: 'http://faucet.alpha.testnet.dwallet.cloud/gas',
    recipient: '<YOUR DWALLET ACCOUNT ADDRESS>',
});

console.log(response);
```

If you're working with a local network, replace `'http://faucet.alpha.testnet.dwallet.cloud/gas'` with `'http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas'`.

## Test tokens on a local network

If you are running a local dWallet network, you can get tokens from your local faucet. See the [Connect to a Local Network](./local-network.mdx#use-the-local-faucet) topic for details.
